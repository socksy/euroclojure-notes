* Clojure on android
** Why?
Because we can. And it's better than Java.
*** But what about clojurescript + react native/phonegap?
This has lots of layers. Android -> Javascript -> React -> Clojurescript -> Reagent/whatever
*** Reasons
**** Closer to native
**** Better tooling with cider etc
**** Can always use interop for things we haven't wrapped yet.
**** Android is not javascript --- we have multiple threads!
