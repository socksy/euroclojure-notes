* Clojure Bridge
** What is clojure bridge?
Coding workshop for women, run by volunteers, to introduce people to clojure.
*** The hope is that they continue after the workshop, continuing to be part of the community and creating things.
** Diversity
Diversity as a concept - usually concentrate on women, because they're the largest under represented group.
But can include ethnic minorities, LGBTQIA, disability, class/economic background
*** Will refer mostly to women, but most is applicable to other groups
** Clojurebridge edinburgh
<woo Edinburgh <3 >
Funding from github, scott logic, ncr, scotland is etc.
*** Ugly location, but nice view of the castle.
*** Why?
Attended an event of clojure launchpad, but she was (almost) the only woman there
People are missing out!
** Based on RailsBridge
1 day workshops
Bridge gaps between communities, between people who feel excluded, those that live and breathe it.
** ClojureBridge spreading around the world slowly
<also Berlin, hint hint>
UK, Germany, Finland, Sweden.
But there's lots of companies not covered. If you're in one of those other countries, consider running a workshop!
** Comparisons
*** Rails bridge, rails girls, django girls. 
RailsBridge is more of a US based one.
** Why outreach?
*** FP communities especially are bad for beginners. Either too condescending, or too obtuse.
** Hacker School rules
*** no feigned surprise
"I can't believe you don't know what [x] is!"
*** no 'well actually's
Just an excuse to show off their knowledge.
*** no back-seat driving
Let people work out things for their own. It's the way they learn.
*** no subtle -isms
"You code well for a girl", etc.
** Odd one out
People showing their unknown biases, with e.g. "Clojure Guys". Assumed you belong to admin staff. Or just attributing something about a single person to the entire group of people that they belong to.
** Comfort levels
An example was with a running group, when a leader took them into an unlit, possibly dangerous area, but the leader didn't realise that - he ran it all the time.
But comfort level is an individual thing.
** Growing a community
It's easy to think that people that share one thing, e.g. interest in clojure, will share similar views on lots of other things.
*** Can use a code of conduct
But it's good to consult an outside group
** Teaching aims
*** Lots of these involve creating a website
**** but this can lead to a lot of times just grappling with the framework, and can leave you thinking you don't really grok the system
*** Clojure though, is modern, minimal keywords and syntax.
Arguably, FP is easier to learn than OOP from beginning too.
It's also pretty portable, useful for a workshop.
**** The REPL
*** Should it be a first language though?
**** Not designed as a beginner language.
One example is the massive stack trace when you get something wrong.
**** Can always get them into coding, and switch them into clojure when they obviously realise it's the best language < ;-) >
** Contribute
Particularly good ideas: organize, volunteer, sponsor, contribute (to the curriculum on GH)
** Boot strapping diversity
Bit of a chicken and egg situation. Want to hire women, but there are no women clojure programmers!
*** Recruit women from other languages!
*** Also recruit former students to teach
** Teacher trainings
Social comfort, teaching people how to approach the goals mentioned above. How to engage with people, and how to keep people in their comfort areas etc.
*** side effect, gives men an insight of diversity

** Lessons learned
*** Curriculum used to be far too long for a day. Difficulty setting things up too.
Now using the Quil library for drawing.
** Impact
*** Even if they don't go into clojure, the mind virus of FP has infected the attendees.
*** More diversity in the community
*** Virtuous circle
More clojure programmers -> More clojure in production -> More Clojure jobs -> More learners (recur)
** Questions
*** Why should we encourage women to join?
<really?>
**** Diversity in backgrounds, life experiences. White men dominate the programming community to a long shot.
<applause after the aghast look>
*** Consider making the curriculum have advanced + intermediate parts too?
**** Yes. In progress. It's on github. Contribute.
