* Real estate Clojure
** rightmove, the UK real estate portal
Zoopla comes on the stage, fun duopoly. Not good for estate agent (real estate brokers) because they have to pay to go on these sites.
Estate agents just want something for a voice <this sounds a bit like marketing bollocks>.
**  Requirements
Consumer portal
Data Processing pipeline
Estate Agents Portal
Internal support tools
** So how does Clojure fit in?
*** Huge product build, non-negotiable deadline
*** So Clojure is the solution?
**** Data transformation. The project is just data moving around.
**** Conservative choice
Obviously.
**** Community cohesion
