* Notes from Euroclojure
So I don't know how to use org mode, nor do I understand half the talks going on, and the stuff I am writing is almost entirely wrong. Feel free to give pull requests to fix everything.)

Also, I've notice that I'm using org mode entirely wrong to get GitHub to render it properly. Everything seems to be a header. But hey, it looks a lot prettier in spacemacs!
